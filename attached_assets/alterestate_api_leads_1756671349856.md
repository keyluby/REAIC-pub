    }

### 

üìå Notes

*   UTM parameters help you track the origin of the lead for better attribution.
    
*   If `round_robin` is not specified, the lead will follow your company's default assignment logic.
    
*   If the lead already exists in your system and duplicate contacts are disabled, no new contact will be created.
    

### 

üß† Duplicate Lead Handling

AlterEstate provides a configuration setting per company to allow or disallow duplicate contacts.

If **duplicates are not allowed**, and a contact with the same phone or email already exists, **the system will not create a new contact or deal**. Instead:

*   It will notify the agent who owns the existing contact.
    
*   It will return a response indicating the lead already exists.
    

#### 

üîÅ Response for Duplicate Contact

Copy

    {
      "status": 200,
      "message": "This contact already exists. No new deal was created.",
      "log_id": "LOG123456"
    }

Field

Type

Description

`status`

`number`

Always `200`, since the request was processed successfully.

`message`

`string`

Explains that no new deal was created due to duplicate contact.

`log_id`

`string`

ID of the internal log entry created for tracking this event.

> ‚úÖ If your company prefers to allow duplicates (for example, if the same person can inquire multiple times), you can adjust this setting in your AlterEstate company configuration panel.
